# Language Evolution on Historical Population Structures â€” Starter

This repo scaffolds a reproducible pipeline to:

(1) fetch/clean representative social-network data across eras,

(2) measure structural targets (degree tail, clustering, assortativity, modularity, path lengths, geo kernels, temporal burstiness),

(3) generate synthetic networks matched to those targets for running your language-evolution model.

See `scripts/fetch_*.md` for dataset links and access notes. Run `examples/run_measurements.py` to generate demo metrics from synthetic graphs.
